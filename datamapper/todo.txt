DataMapper v2 Todo:
==================

-> remaining API functionality
   - save
   - delete
   - update
   - truncate
   x all internal validation functions
   x count (and variations)
   x pages methods
   x func support
   - subquery support
   x related query methods
   x include related methods
   - join field methods
   - auto populate features

-> adding support for soft_delete:
   - update delete_field instead of delete record
   - include where(delete_field IS NULL) in queries
   - NOTE: do we need an undelete?
   - NOTE: do we need to be able to selected deleted records?
   - implement this as an extension (which overloads save/delete/get?)
     if so, how to call the "parent", extensions onkly have internal access

-> adding support for observers:
   - have them deal with created / updated
   - have them deal with soft_delete too?
   
-> save
   - implement cascading save for related objects

-> model relations
   - populate the models relations with the "other side"?
     this can be done during setup, and written to the cache file
     it will save a lot of unneeded object instantiations just to get 
     the relationship information from the other side of the relation
     
-> documentation
   - /parent is not documented (to link to the parent object in func() subqueries
