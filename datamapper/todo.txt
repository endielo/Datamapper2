DataMapper v2 Todo:
==================

-> remaining API functionality
   - save
   - delete
   - update
   - truncate
   - all internal validation functions
   - count (and variations)
   - pages methods
   - func support
   - subquery support
   - include related methods
   - join field methods

-> adding support for soft_delete:
   - update delete_field instead of delete record
   - include where(delete_field IS NULL) in queries
   - NOTE: do we need an undelete?
   - NOTE: do we need to be able to selected deleted records?
